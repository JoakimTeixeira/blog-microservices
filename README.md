Implementation and analysis of microservices trade-offs

## Traditional approach: Monolith

Best suited for smaller teams/projects needing fast delivery and simplicity over distributed scalability

### Pros:

- Easier to deploy as a single codebase
- Faster intercommunication between modules
- Simpler to maintain transactional data consistency
- Lower overall computational and infrastructure costs

### Cons:

- Harder to scale or isolate specific modules
- Riskier deployments due to shared dependencies
- Harder to adopt new technologies due to tight integration
- More prone to full-system outages from a single failure
- Cumbersome to manage a growing codebase and release cycles
